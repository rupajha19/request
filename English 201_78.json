The standard word order in English is: \n\n\n\n`Subject + Verb + Object.` \n\n\n\nTo determine the proper sequence of words, you need to understand what the subject, verb and object(s) are.\n\n\n\n```\n* Subject: typically a noun or pronoun\u2014the person, place or thing\n* Verb: the action or state of being\n* Object: the word or group of words influenced by the verb\n```\nThe sequence of words is critical when communicating in English because it can impact the meaning of what you\u2019re trying to say. The sentence, \u201cThe chicken crossed the road\u201d and \u201cThe road crossed the chicken\u201d take on two different meanings because the subject and object are inverted. The same would be `true` if the verb was used out of order, for example: \u201cCrossed the road the chicken.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s one for you to try. Choose the correct word order for the group of words below:\n\n\n\n\n1. Dropped the ball the boy\n\n2. The boy dropped the ball.\n\n3. The ball dropped the boy.\n\n\n\nIf you chose option B, you would be correct. \n\n\n\n---\n\nExercises:\n\nA. Identify the subject, verb and object in the following sentences.\n\n\n  \n1.
