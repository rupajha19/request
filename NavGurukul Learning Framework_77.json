As an outsider, this may help you to understand our thought process and may be borrow some ideas, or help us with your ideas. As a student, this can help you to see if there is an alignment between what we think, and what you think is good for you. You may need to read this document again and again before you can align yourself with and understand fully the ideas mentioned in the document.\n\n\n\nThere are two crucial components at NavGurukul - Learning and Serving. And these two components plays out in various forms to shape our culture. While it is easy to understand, that learning is important and can\u2019t be compromised with, it requires some understanding so as how serving is equally important and a part of our DNA and culture.\n\n"

While that is a great ideal to uphold, but it is important to understand that it would require a very directed and thorough `input` to achieve this. To understand simply, a lot of `input` is needed for this to be really possible. Given this `input`, what should we expect out of the people who achieve this **free** education.\n\n\n\nShould this **free** education focus them on providing a **passport to privilege** or should they  have an obligation to serve others?\n\n\n\nIt might be important here to understand what privilege means. Privilege is what helps us where we reach where we are. Privilege is what separates us from someone who never went to school. When we achieve something, we feel that we have an important role in achieving that. While it can\u2019t be argued otherwise, but at the same time role that the privilege might have played to make that happen may be far greater than you have imagined to be. Privilege is a big topic of its own, and we would encourage you to read more about it on the Internet. By the way, the fact that you are able to use Internet has also been made possible because of the privilege you enjoy. In India, only 33% people have the privilege of using the Internet.\n\n\n\nIt should be thus realised, that the fact that we are able to achieve this education at NavGurukul is because of whatever little or great privilege that we have. Similarly, the fact that NavGurukul exists is, because of two reasons\n\n- there were patrons like donors, team members, etc. who decided to **serve** you\n\n- these patrons themselves had the privilege to serve you\n\n\n\nIt would be fair to expect that these patrons who wanted to serve people, who need help, want to serve as many people as they can and not create a group of privileged people. The size of problems that we are dealing with - poverty, abuse, casteism, etc. are humongous and can\u2019t be solved unless you play your role in solving them. While we strongly argue that the students coming out of the system should serve people, we clearly understand and believe that you would have your own style of serving people, and no particular format of service is expected. You can choose to serve in your own ways, that suits you, that makes you happier.\n\n\n\nTo serve others, you need to have a certain comfort level at your end. If you are suffering from problems at your end or lack of resources (e.g. time, money, etc.), it would be harder to serve others. We believe that rather than postponing to serve in the future, start serving in a small way that makes you happy and isn\u2019t too hard on you. The idea of serving in future, rather in present would be lucrative to one and all. And it would be expected that you are truthful to yourself, and realise an urgent and important need to serve others.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, we do understand that the **idea to serve** can\u2019t be forced upon an individual, and hence the idea is not to force people to serve but to create an environment where students can understand the importance of serving others, and at the same time find an alignment with their happiness.\n\n\n\nWe will come back to **how to serve**, once we have covered **how to learn**.\n\n"

                        "value": "How to Learn?\n\nWe have been learning since the moment we were born, all throughout our life. We learn from what we see, what we hear, and most importantly what we do. Yet, when we move to more specialised forms of learning, e.g. Software Engineering, learning appears to be a little complicated. A lot of complication is a part of how we teach, how learning doesn\u2019t use the context properly, etc. Yet learning a skill like Software Engineering requires more - hard work, discipline, commitment, seriousness, etc.\n\n\n\nWe are going to talk some of the factors that we believe are important for learning, and can\u2019t be ignored. These factors help us design the experience at NavGurukul, and at the same time should also be helpful for you to evaluate and improve your learning.\n\n\n\nStudents will be defined as Juniors or Seniors as per following.\n\n- when you join NavGurukul as a student (Juniors)\n\n- when you start working outside NavGurukul (as an Intern or as a full time hire) or six months have been spent whichever is later (Seniors)\nThis classification will be used in later sections as different expectations are there from the Juniors or Seniors. For example, each Senior student mentor one or two Junior students and are responsible for their learning.\n\n\n\nHealthy Mind\n\nHealthy mind is the first and foremost step to learn properly. If you are distracted, lack curiosity, or simply not able to enjoy your learning processes it would be very hard for you to learn. There can be many forms of distractions which let you not learn properly. While some of them are easy to be ignored, some others aren\u2019t as easy. For example, using facebook or WhatsApp are distractions and students should stay away from them. In fact, we would wish to advise all the Junior students to deactivate their facebook and WhatsApp pro`files`.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, there are problems which have no clear solution or path ahead. For example, issues related to illness of a close family member are harder to be dealt with. These often create an emotional toll which makes it harder for us to focus on our learning. Meditation and counselling can be of huge help in such cases.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, it is important that you love what you are doing. If you feel disinterested or disengaged with whatever you learning, it will be hard for you to learn it properly. While it is not necessary for you to learn complete Software Engineering, but it is important to fall in love with some or other components and excel on them. Learning only for a future job often leads to drastically poor results.\n\n\n\nCurious mind is another very important part of a healthy mind. It helps you explore and learn beyond what you listen or hear. We are all blessed with a curious mind, though we stop asking questions during our childhood. It is very important that we get back our eagerness to ask questions and learn new things.\n\n\n\nIn case you feel, that you aren\u2019t feeling mentally healthy, don\u2019t worry. Talk to your facilitator and the facilitator should be able to suggest you the next steps.\n\n\n\nSeriousness\n\nOften during the course due to variety of reasons, you may not feel serious about what you are studying and start taking things lightly. It is easy to see how if you are not serious, you aren\u2019t only wasting your time but also others\u2019 time. By design, our course has as an intense nature with more than 12-14 productive hours a day, and keeping yourself and committed throughout is the `key` thing. If you feel that you need a break due to the rigorous schedule, there are ample ways to do so.\n\n\n\nIt is also important to understand that we run on limited resources (money from donors, and time & dedication of seniors and volunteers to teach you). It would be a pity that you are wasting those resources by not being serious enough. You should talk to your mentor immediately and discuss the potential reasons for feeling so. If you continue to stay non-serious for long, mentor would be expected to hand over a card with a strong warning to you.\n\n\n\nIntrospection\n\nWhen you are doing so many things, there are always chances that there are things not being done right or things which could be done better. You need to introspect daily and understand yourself in more depth. Introspect is one way, we learn most about ourselves, and hence it directly helps us to identify our weaknesses and strengths and improve ourselves. Here, are a few things that must be done for introspection.\n\n\n\nDaily Standups\n\nThis is the most crucial and a non-compromisable step. Every day learning should start with a 15-20 mins standup where all the students of a particular group stand up and answer following questions individually:\n\n\n\nMaintain a diary\n\nThis is your personal space to write in somewhat more detail about the day - how did the things go, how can they be made better, are you not able to focus, if you aren\u2019t able to focus - why you aren\u2019t able to focus, and so on.\n\n\n\nMentor Slots\n\nWeekly community meetings\n\nHard Work\n\nDiscipline\n\nTechnique - Active vs Passive\n\nTeaching Others\n\nRevision\n\nAptitude\n\nOne of the questions that has always puzzled us is the relation between aptitude and subsequent learning. We have seen various manifestations between aptitude and how people learn in especially later part of their lives. What is aptitude? How aptitude is built? What role has the nature to play, and what role does the nurture has to play? While all these questions are quite interesting, it is important to understand that aptitude is a small part of learning and can be overshadowed with other factors if done properly. We can see examples all around where students who appear to have lesser aptitude appear to score much better than the students who appear to have better aptitude. We will thus focus on these factors in this report.\n\n"
